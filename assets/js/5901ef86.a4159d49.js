Conditional clients are essential for integration with modular blockchains which break up consensus and state management, such as rollups. Currently, light clients receive a single provable store they maintain. There is a unidirectional communication channel with 02-client: the 02-client module will call into the light client, without allowing for the light client to call into the 02-client module. But modular blockchains break up a logical blockchain into many constituent parts, so in order to accurately represent these chains and also to account for various types of shared security primitives that are coming up, we need to introduce dependencies between clients. In the case of optimistic rollups, for example, in order to prove execution (allowing for fraud proofs), you must prove data availability and sequencing. A potential solution to this problem is that a light client may optionally specify a list of dependencies and the 02-client module would lookup read-only provable stores for each dependency and provide this to the conditional client to perform verification.
