# Business requirements

> **TL;DR**: There is no general incentivization mechanism to reward relayers for their service ensuring Interchain liveness.

## Problem

The Interchain dream will never scale unless there is a clear way to incentivize relayers. An interface that can be easily adopted by any applications is needed, without precluding chains that do not use tokens.

Though IBC does not depend on relayer operators for transaction verification, the relayer infrastructure ensures liveness of the Interchain network â€” operators listen for packets sent through channels opened between chains, and perform the vital service of ferrying these packets (and proof of the transaction on the sending chain/receipt on the receiving chain) to the clients on each side of the channel. Though relaying is permissionless and completely decentralized and accessible, it does come with operational costs. Running full nodes to query transaction proofs and paying for transaction fees associated with IBC packets are two of the primary cost burdens which have driven the overall discussion on a general incentivization mechanism for relayers.

## Objectives

Provide a general fee payment design that can be adopted by any ICS application protocol as middleware.

## Scope

| Features  | Release |
| --------- | ------- |
| Incentivize timely delivery of a packet (successfully submit `MsgRecvPacket`). | v1 |
| Incentivize relaying acknowledgement for a packet (successfully submit `MsgAcknowledgement`). | v1 |
| Incentivize relaying timeout for a packet when the timeout has expired before packet is delivered (successfully submit `MsgTimeout`). | v1 |
| Enable permissionless or permissioned relaying. | v1 |
| Allow opt-in for chains (an application with fee support on chain A could connect to the couterparty application without fee support on chain B). | v1 |

# User requirements

## Use cases

- A packet already sent may be incentivized for one or more of the messages `MsgRecvPacket`, `MsgAcknowledgement`, `MsgTimeout`.
- The next packet to be sent may be incentivized for one or more of the messages `MsgRecvPacket`, `MsgAcknowledgement`, `MsgTimeout`.

# Functional requirements

## Assumptions

1. Relayer addresses should not be forgeable.

## Known limitations

1. Without channel upgradability it is not possible to use fee incentivization on an existing channel.

## Terminology

See section [Definitions](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc/tree/main/spec/app/ics-029-fee-payment#definitions) in ICS 29 spec.
