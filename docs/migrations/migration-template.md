# Migrating from <old-version> to <new-version>

This guide provides instructions for migrating to a new version of ibc-go.

There are four sections based on the four potential user groups of this document:
- [Chains](#chains)
- [IBC Apps](#ibc-apps)
- [Relayers](#relayers)
- [IBC Light Clients](#ibc-light-clients)

**Note:** ibc-go supports golang semantic versioning and therefore all imports must be updated on major version releases.
