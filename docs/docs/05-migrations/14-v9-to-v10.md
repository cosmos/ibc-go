# Migrating from v9 to v10

This guide provides instructions for migrating to a new version of ibc-go.

There are four sections based on the four potential user groups of this document:

- [Chains](#chains)
- [IBC Apps](#ibc-apps)
        - [ICS27 - Interchain Accounts](#ics27---interchain-accounts)
- [Relayers](#relayers)
- [IBC Light Clients](#ibc-light-clients)

**Note:** ibc-go supports golang semantic versioning and therefore all imports must be updated on major version releases.

## Chains

- No relevant changes were made in this release.

## IBC Apps

### ICS27 - Interchain Accounts

The channel capability migration introduced in v6 has been removed. Chains must upgrade from v6 or higher. 

## Relayers

- No relevant changes were made in this release.

## IBC Light Clients
