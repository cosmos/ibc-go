# Migrating from v9 to v10

This guide provides instructions for migrating to a new version of ibc-go.

There are four sections based on the four potential user groups of this document:

- [Chains](#chains)
- [IBC Apps](#ibc-apps)
        - [ICS27 - Interchain Accounts](#ics27---interchain-accounts)
- [Relayers](#relayers)
- [IBC Light Clients](#ibc-light-clients)

**Note:** ibc-go supports golang semantic versioning and therefore all imports must be updated on major version releases.

## Chains

- No relevant changes were made in this release.

## IBC Apps

- (TODO: expand later) Removal of capabilities in `SendPacket` [\#7213](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/7213).
- (TODO: expand later) Removal of capabilities in `WriteAcknowledgement` [\#7225](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/7213).
- (TODO: expand later) Removal of capabilities in channel handshake methods [\#7232](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/7232).
- (TODO: expand later) More removal of capabilities in [\#7270](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/7270).
