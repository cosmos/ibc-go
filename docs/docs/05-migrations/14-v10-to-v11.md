# Migrating from v10 to v11

This guide provides instructions for migrating to a new version of ibc-go.

**Note:** ibc-go supports golang semantic versioning and therefore all imports must be updated on major version releases.

Diff examples are shown after the list of overall changes:

- Chains will need to remove the `ParamSubspace` arg from all calls to `Keeper` constructors

```diff
  app.IBCKeeper = ibckeeper.NewKeeper(
    appCodec,
    runtime.NewKVStoreService(keys[ibcexported.StoreKey]),
-   app.GetSubspace(ibcexported.ModuleName),
    app.UpgradeKeeper,
    authtypes.NewModuleAddress(govtypes.ModuleName).String(),
  )
```
