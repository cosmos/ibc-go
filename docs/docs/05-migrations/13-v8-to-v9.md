**Note:** ibc-go supports golang semantic versioning and therefore all imports must be updated on major version releases.

## Chains

Chains will need to remove the route for the legacy proposal handler for 02-client from their `app/app.go`:

```diff
// app.go
govRouter.AddRoute(govtypes.RouterKey, govv1beta1.ProposalHandler).
- AddRoute(paramproposal.RouterKey, params.NewParamChangeProposalHandler(app.ParamsKeeper)).
- AddRoute(ibcclienttypes.RouterKey, ibcclient.NewClientProposalHandler(app.IBCKeeper.ClientKeeper))
+ AddRoute(paramproposal.RouterKey, params.NewParamChangeProposalHandler(app.ParamsKeeper))
```

## IBC core

- Because the self client and consensus state validation has been removed from the connection handshake (see section [Removal of self client and consensus state from connection handshake](#removal-of-self-client-and-consensus-state-from-connection-handshake) for more details), the IBC core keeper does not need the staking keeper anymore to introspect the (self) past historical info at a given height and construct the expected consensus state at that height. Thus, the signature of IBC core keeper constructor function `NewKeeper` has been updated:

```diff
func NewKeeper(
  cdc codec.BinaryCodec, key storetypes.StoreKey, paramSpace types.ParamSubspace,
- stakingKeeper clienttypes.StakingKeeper, 
  upgradeKeeper clienttypes.UpgradeKeeper,
  scopedKeeper capabilitykeeper.ScopedKeeper, authority string,
) *Keeper 
```

### API removals

- The [`exported.ChannelI`](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/v8.0.0/modules/core/exported/channel.go#L3-L11) and [`exported.CounterpartyChannelI`](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/v8.0.0/modules/core/exported/channel.go#L13-L19) interfaces have been removed. Please use the concrete types.
- The [`exported.ConnectionI`](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/v8.0.0/modules/core/exported/connection.go#L6-L13) and [`exported.CounterpartyConnectionI`](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/v8.0.0/modules/core/exported/connection.go#L15-L21) interfaces have been removed. Please use the concrete types.
- The [`Router` reference](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/v8.0.0/modules/core/keeper/keeper.go#L35) has been removed from the IBC core keeper in [#6138](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/6138). Please use `PortKeeper.Router` instead. 
- The [composite interface `QueryServer`](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/v8.0.0/modules/core/types/query.go#L14-L19) has been removed from package `core/types`. Please use the granular `QueryServer` interfaces for IBC submodules directly.
- The [`TypeClientMisbehaviour` constant](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/v8.0.0/modules/core/exported/client.go#L17) has been removed.
- The function [`SetConsensusHost`](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/v8.3.0/modules/core/keeper/keeper.go#L88-L96) has been removed because the self client and consensus state validation has been removed from the connection handshake. See section [Removal of self client and consensus state from connection handshake](#removal-of-self-client-and-consensus-state-from-connection-handshake) for more details.

### 02-client

- The `QueryVerifyMembershipRequest` protobuf message has been modified to include `commitment.v2.MerklePath`. The deprecated `commitment.v1.MerklePath` field has been `reserved`. [See 23-commitment](#23-commitment).
- The function [`CreateLocalhostClient`](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/v8.0.0/modules/core/02-client/keeper/keeper.go#L56) has been removed. The localhost client is now stateless.
- The function [`NewClientProposalHandler`](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/v8.0.0/modules/core/02-client/proposal_handler.go#L18) has been removed in [#6777](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/6777).
- The deprecated [`ClientUpdateProposal` and `UpgradeProposal` messages](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/v8.0.0/proto/ibc/core/client/v1/client.proto#L67-L113) have been removed in [\#6782](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/6782). Please use [`MsgRecoverClient`](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/release/v9.0.x/proto/ibc/core/client/v1/tx.proto#L125-L138) and [`MsgIBCSoftwareUpgrade`](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/release/v9.0.x/proto/ibc/core/client/v1/tx.proto#L143-L158) respectively instead.
- Because the self client and consensus state validation has been removed from the connection handshake (see section [Removal of self client and consensus state from connection handshake](#removal-of-self-client-and-consensus-state-from-connection-handshake) for more details):
    - The [ConsensusHost interface](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/v8.3.0/modules/core/02-client/types/client.go#L25-L29) has been removed.
    - The function [`SetConsensusHost`](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/v8.3.0/modules/core/02-client/keeper/keeper.go#L61-L68) has been removed.
    - The functions [`GetSelfConsensusState` and `ValidateSelfClient`](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/v8.3.0/modules/core/02-client/keeper/keeper.go#L256-L269) have been removed.

### 03-connection

- The [functions `GetState()`, `GetClientID()`, `GetCounterparty()`, `GetVersions()`, and `GetDelayPeriod()`](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/v8.0.0/modules/core/03-connection/types/connection.go#L25-L48) of the `Connection` type have been removed.
- The [functions `GetClientID()`, `GetConnectionID()`, and `GetPrefix()`](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/v8.0.0/modules/core/03-connection/types/connection.go#L79-L92) of the `Counterparty` type have been removed.

#### Removal of self client and consensus state from connection handshake

The `ConnectionOpenTry` and `ConnectionOpenAck` handlers no longer validate that the light client on counterparty chain has a valid representation of the executing chain's consensus protocol (please see [#1128](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc/pull/1128) in cosmos/ibc repository for an exhaustive explanation of the reasoning). 

- The fields `client_state`, `proof_client`, `proof_consensus`, `consensus_height` and `host_consensus_state_proof` of `MsgConnectionOpenTry` and `MsgConnectionOpenAck` have been deprecated, and the signature of the constructor functions [`NewMsgConnectionOpenTry`](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/release/v9.0.x/modules/core/03-connection/types/msgs.go#L78) and [`NewMsgConnectionOpenTry`](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/release/v9.0.x/modules/core/03-connection/types/msgs.go#L165) has been accordingly updated:

```diff
func NewMsgConnectionOpenTry(
  clientID, counterpartyConnectionID, counterpartyClientID string,
- counterpartyClient exported.ClientState,
  counterpartyPrefix commitmenttypes.MerklePrefix,
  counterpartyVersions []*Version, delayPeriod uint64,
  initProof []byte,
- clientProof []byte,
- consensusProof []byte,
  proofHeight lienttypes.Height,
- consensusHeight clienttypes.Height,
  signer string,
) *MsgConnectionOpenTry

func NewMsgConnectionOpenAck(
  connectionID, counterpartyConnectionID string, 
- counterpartyClient exported.ClientState,
  tryProof []byte,
- clientProof []byte,
- consensusProof []byte,
  proofHeight clienttypes.Height,
- consensusHeight clienttypes.Height,
  version *Version,
  signer string,
) *MsgConnectionOpenAck
```

- The functions [`VerifyClientState` and `VerifyClientConsensusState`](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/v8.3.0/modules/core/03-connection/keeper/verify.go#L20-L101) have been removed.
- The function [`UnpackInterfaces`](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/v8.0.0/modules/core/03-connection/types/msgs.go#L166) has been removed.

### 04-channel

- The utility function [`QueryLatestConsensusState`](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/v8.0.0/modules/core/04-channel/client/utils/utils.go#L130) of the CLI has been removed.
- The [functions `GetState()`, `GetOrdering()`, `GetCounterparty()`, `GetConnectionHops()`, `GetVersion()`](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/v8.0.0/modules/core/04-channel/types/channel.go#L29-L52) of the `Channel` type have been removed.
- The [functions `IsOpen()` and `IsClosed()`](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/v8.0.0/modules/core/04-channel/types/channel.go#L54-L62) of the `Channel` type have been removed.
- The [functions `GetPortID()`, `GetChannelID()`](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/v8.0.0/modules/core/04-channel/types/channel.go#L92-L100) of the `CounterpartyChannel` type have been removed.
- Functions [`ChanCloseConfirmWithCounterpartyUpgradeSequence`](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/v8.1.0/modules/core/04-channel/keeper/handshake.go#L446) and [`TimeoutOnCloseWithCounterpartyUpgradeSequence`](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/v8.1.0/modules/core/04-channel/keeper/timeout.go#L226) have been removed. Please use `ChanCloseConfirm` and `TimeoutOnClose` with the updated signature that takes the counterparty upgrade sequence as extra argument:

```diff
func (k *Keeper) ChanCloseConfirm(
  ctx sdk.Context,
  portID,
  channelID string,
  chanCap *capabilitytypes.Capability,
  initProof []byte,
  proofHeight exported.Height,
+	counterpartyUpgradeSequence uint64,
)

func (k *Keeper) TimeoutOnClose(
  ctx sdk.Context,
  chanCap *capabilitytypes.Capability,
  packet types.Packet,
  proof,
  closedProof []byte,
  proofHeight exported.Height,
  nextSequenceRecv uint64,
+	counterpartyUpgradeSequence uint64,
) 
```

- The keeper handlers `RecvPacket`, `AcknowledgePacket`, `TimeoutPacket` and `TimeoutOnClose` now return the channel version, which the message server passes to the packet lifecycle application callbacks (`OnRecvPacket`, `OnAcknowledgementPacket` and `OnTimeoutPacket`). The channel version is useful when adding backwards compatible features to an existing application implementation (for example: in the context of ICS20 v2, middleware and the transfer application may use the channel version to unmarshal the packet differently depending on the channel version).

```diff
func (k *Keeper) RecvPacket(
  ctx sdk.Context,
  chanCap *capabilitytypes.Capability,
  packet types.Packet,
  proof []byte,
  proofHeight exported.Height,
- ) error { 
+ ) (string, error) {

func (k *Keeper) AcknowledgePacket(
  ctx sdk.Context,
  chanCap *capabilitytypes.Capability,
  packet types.Packet,
  acknowledgement []byte,
  proof []byte,
  proofHeight exported.Height,
- ) error {
+ ) (string, error) {

func (k *Keeper) TimeoutPacket(
  ctx sdk.Context,
  packet types.Packet,
  proof []byte,
  proofHeight exported.Height,
  nextSequenceRecv uint64,
- ) error {
+ ) (string, error) {

func (k *Keeper) TimeoutOnClose(
  ctx sdk.Context,
  chanCap *capabilitytypes.Capability,
  packet types.Packet,
  proof,
  closedProof []byte,
  proofHeight exported.Height,
  nextSequenceRecv uint64,
  counterpartyUpgradeSequence uint64,
- ) error {
+ ) (string, error) {
```

```diff
OnRecvPacket func(
  ctx sdk.Context,
+ channelVersion string,
  packet channeltypes.Packet,
  relayer sdk.AccAddress,
) exported.Acknowledgement

OnAcknowledgementPacket func(
  ctx sdk.Context,
+ channelVersion string,
  packet channeltypes.Packet,
  acknowledgement []byte,
  relayer sdk.AccAddress,
) error

OnTimeoutPacket func(
  ctx sdk.Context,
+ channelVersion string,
  packet channeltypes.Packet,
  relayer sdk.AccAddress,
) error
```

### 05-port

- The signature of the `UnmarshalPacketData` function of the `PacketDataUnmarshaler` interface takes now extra arguments for the context and the port and channel identifiers. These parameters have been added so that implementations of the interface function can retrieve the channel version, which allows the provided packet data to be unmarshaled based on the channel version. In addition to these, `UnmarshalPacketData` now also returns the underlying application's version:

```diff
type PacketDataUnmarshaler interface {
  UnmarshalPacketData(
+   ctx sdk.Context,
+   portID, 
+   channelID string,
    bz []byte,
+ ) (interface{}, string, error)
}
```

### 23-commitment

- The [`exported.Proof`](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/v8.0.0/modules/core/exported/commitment.go#L34-L44) interface has been removed. Please use the [`MerkleProof`](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/release/v9.0.x/modules/core/23-commitment/types/commitment.pb.go#L161-L168) concrete type.
- The [`MerklePath` type](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/release/v9.0.x/modules/core/23-commitment/types/commitment.pb.go#L113-L119) has been deprecated and a new [`commitment.v2.MerklePath` type](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/release/v9.0.x/modules/core/23-commitment/types/v2/commitment.pb.go#L25-L30) has been introduced in [#6644](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/6644). The new `commitment.v2.MerklePath` contains `repeated bytes` in favour of `repeated string`. This allows users to prove values stored under keys which contain non-utf8 encoded symbols. As a result, changes have been made to the 02-client `Query` service and 08-wasm contract API messages for JSON blobs. See [02-client](#02-client) and [08-wasm](#08-wasm), respectively.
- The `commitment.v1.MerklePath` type has been removed and a new `commitment.v2.MerklePath` type has been introduced in [#6644](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/6644). The new `commitment.v2.MerklePath` contains `repeated bytes` in favour of `repeated string`. This allows users to prove values stored under keys which contain non-utf8 encoded symbols. As a result, changes have been made to the 02-client `Query` service and 08-wasm contract API messages for JSON blobs. See [02-client](#02-client) and [08-wasm](#08-wasm), respectively.

### 24-host

All functions ending with `Path` naming have been removed in favour of their sibling function which ends in `Key`. 

## IBC Apps

### ICS20 - Transfer

#### ICS20 v2

- With support for multidenom transfer packets and path forwarding, the `NewMsgTransfer` constructor function to create a new `MsgTransfer` instance now accepts multiple coins instead of just one, and an argument with forwarding information:

```diff
func NewMsgTransfer(
  sourcePort, sourceChannel string,
- token sdk.Coin, 
+ tokens sdk.Coins,
  sender, receiver string,
  timeoutHeight clienttypes.Height, timeoutTimestamp uint64,
  memo string,
+ forwarding *Forwarding,
)
```

- The `ibc_transfer` and `fungible_token_packet` events do not include the attributes `denom` and `amount` anymore; instead they include the attribute `tokens` with the list of coins transferred in the packet.
- A new type for the packet payload has been introduced: [`FungibleTokenPacketDataV2`](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/release/v9.0.x/proto/ibc/applications/transfer/v2/packet.proto#L27-L41). Transfer channels with version `ics20-2` will use this new type for the payload and it will be encoded using Protobuf (instead of JSON). Middleware that wraps the transfer application and unmarshals the packet data MUST take this into account when upgrading: depending on the channel version, packet data should unmarshal either as JSON (v1) or Protobuf (v2). The helper function [`UnmarshalPacketData`](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/release/v9.0.x/modules/apps/transfer/types/packet.go#L212) encapsulates this logic and can be used by middleware or other applications to correctly unmarshal the packet data:

```go
packetData, err := transfertypes.UnmarshalPacketData(packet.Data, version)
if err != nil {
  return err
}
```

#### `DenomTrace` type refactoring

- The [`DenomTrace`](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/v8.0.0/modules/apps/transfer/types/transfer.pb.go#L25-L33) type has been made private and will be completely removed in a later release. Please use the [`Denom` type](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/release/v9.0.x/modules/apps/transfer/types/token.pb.go#L81-L87) instead.
- The [`DenomTrace` and `DenomTraces` gRPCs](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/v8.0.0/modules/apps/transfer/keeper/grpc_query.go#L22-L75) have  been removed as well (together with the and `QueryDenomTraceResponse` and `QueryDenomTracesResponse` types). Please use the [`Denom` and `Denoms` gRPCs](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/release/v9.0.x/modules/apps/transfer/keeper/grpc_query.go#L27-L80) instead.
- An [automatic migration handler](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/release/v9.0.x/modules/apps/transfer/keeper/migrations.go#L75-L113) is also configured to migrate the storage from using `DenomTrace` to `Denom`.
- The [`denomination_trace` event emitted in the `OnRecvPacket` callback](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/v8.0.0/modules/apps/transfer/keeper/relay.go#L268-L274) has been replaced with the [`denom` event](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/release/v9.0.x/modules/apps/transfer/keeper/relay.go#L230).
- The functions [`SenderChainIsSource` and `ReceiverChainIsSource`](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/v8.0.0/modules/apps/transfer/types/coin.go#L12-L32) have been replaced with the function `HasPrefix` of the newly added `Denom` type.
- The helper function [`GetTransferCoin`](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/v8.0.0/modules/apps/transfer/types/coin.go#L46) has been removed.
- The helper function [`GetDenomPrefix`](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/v8.0.0/modules/apps/transfer/types/coin.go#L35) has been removed.
- The helper function [`GetPrefixedDenom`](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/v8.0.0/modules/apps/transfer/types/coin.go#L40) has been removed. Please construct the denom using the new [`Denom` type](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/release/v9.0.x/modules/apps/transfer/types/token.pb.go#L82).

### ICS27 - Interchain Accounts

- In [#5785](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/5785) the list of arguments of the `NewKeeper` constructor function of the host submodule was extended with an extra argument for the gRPC query router that the submodule uses when executing a [`MsgModuleQuerySafe`](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/release/v9.0.x/proto/ibc/applications/interchain_accounts/host/v1/tx.proto#L40-L51) to perform queries that are module safe:

```diff
func NewKeeper(
  cdc codec.Codec, key storetypes.StoreKey, legacySubspace icatypes.ParamSubspace,
  ics4Wrapper porttypes.ICS4Wrapper, channelKeeper icatypes.ChannelKeeper,
  portKeeper icatypes.PortKeeper,	accountKeeper icatypes.AccountKeeper, 
  scopedKeeper exported.ScopedKeeper, msgRouter icatypes.MessageRouter,
+ queryRouter icatypes.QueryRouter, 
  authority string,
) Keeper
```

- The function [`RegisterInterchainAccountWithOrdering`](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/v8.3.0/modules/apps/27-interchain-accounts/controller/keeper/account.go#L68) has been removed. The legacy function `RegisterInterchainAccount` now takes an extra parameter to specify the ordering of new ICA channels:

```diff
func (k Keeper) RegisterInterchainAccount(
  ctx sdk.Context,
  connectionID, owner,
  version string,
+ ordering channeltypes.Order
) error {
```

- The `requests` repeated field of `MsgModuleQuerySafe` has been marked non-nullable, and therefore the signature of the constructor function `NewMsgModuleQuerySafe` has been updated:

```diff
func NewMsgModuleQuerySafe(
  signer string, 
- requests []*QueryRequest,
+ requests []QueryRequest,
) *MsgModuleQuerySafe {
```

- The signature of the [`NewIBCMiddleware` constructor function](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/v8.0.0/modules/apps/27-interchain-accounts/controller/ibc_middleware.go#L35) in the controller submodule now only takes the controller keeper as an argument. The base application is then set by default to nil and thus authentication is assumed to be done by a Cosmos SDK module, such as the `x/gov`, `x/group` or `x/auth`, that sends messages to the controller submodule's message server. An authentication module can be set using the newly added [`NewIBCMiddlewareWithAuth` constructor function](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/release/v9.0.x/modules/apps/27-interchain-accounts/controller/ibc_middleware.go#L46).

```diff
func NewIBCMiddleware(
- app porttypes.IBCModule, 
  k keeper.Keeper,
) IBCMiddleware {
```

- The [`InitModule` function](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/v8.0.0/modules/apps/27-interchain-accounts/module.go#L124-L143) has been removed. When adding the interchain accounts module to the chain, please set the desired params for controller and host submodules directly after calling `RunMigrations` in the upgrade handler.
- The [`GetBytes()` function](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/v8.0.0/modules/apps/27-interchain-accounts/types/packet.go#L65-L68) of the `CosmosTx` type has been removed.

### Callbacks

The `ContractKeeper` interface has been extended with the base application version. The base application version will be required by contracts to unmarshal the packet data. An example of this is unmarshaling ICS20 v2 packets which requires knowing the base version of a transfer stack (either v1 or v2). 

```diff
type ContractKeeper interface {
  IBCSendPacketCallback(
    cachedCtx sdk.Context,
    sourcePort string,
    sourceChannel string,
    timeoutHeight clienttypes.Height,
    timeoutTimestamp uint64,
    packetData []byte,
    contractAddress,
    packetSenderAddress string,
+   version string,
  ) error

  IBCOnAcknowledgementPacketCallback(
    cachedCtx sdk.Context,
    packet channeltypes.Packet,
    acknowledgement []byte,
    relayer sdk.AccAddress,
    contractAddress,
    packetSenderAddress string,
+   version string,
  ) error

  IBCOnTimeoutPacketCallback(
    cachedCtx sdk.Context,
    packet channeltypes.Packet,
    relayer sdk.AccAddress,
    contractAddress,
    packetSenderAddress string,
+   version string,
  ) error

  IBCReceivePacketCallback(
    cachedCtx sdk.Context,
    packet ibcexported.PacketI,
    ack ibcexported.Acknowledgement,
    contractAddress string,
+   version string,
  ) error
}
```

### IBC testing package

- The `mock.PV` type has been removed in favour of [`cmttypes.MockPV`](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/blob/v0.38.5/types/priv_validator.go#L50) in [#5709](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/5709).
- [Functions `ConstructUpdateTMClientHeader` and `ConstructUpdateTMClientHeaderWithTrustedHeight`](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/v8.0.0/testing/chain.go#L446-L481) of `TestChain` type have been replaced with `IBCClientHeader` function. This function will construct a 07-tendermint header to update the light client on the counterparty chain. The trusted height must be passed in as a non-zero height.
- [`GetValsAtHeight`](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/v8.0.0/testing/chain.go#L401) has been renamed to [`GetTrustedValidators`](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/release/v9.0.x/testing/chain.go#L403).
- [`AssertEventsLegacy` function](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/v8.0.0/testing/events.go#L140) of `ibctesting` package (alias for `"github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/v9/testing"`) has been removed in [#6070](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/6070), and [`AssertEvents` function](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/release/v9.0.x/testing/events.go#L187) should be used instead.

```diff
// testing/events.go
- func AssertEventsLegacy(
-   suite *testifysuite.Suite,
-   expected EventsMap,
-   actual []abci.Event,
- )

func AssertEvents(
  suite *testifysuite.Suite,
  expected []abci.Event,
  actual []abci.Event,
)
```

- The [`QueryServer` interface has been removed from the `TestChain` struct](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/v8.0.0/testing/chain.go#L61). Submodule query servers can be constructed directly by passing their associated keeper to the appropriate constructor function. For example:

```golang
clientQueryServer := clientkeeper.NewQueryServer(app.IBCKeeper.ClientKeeper)
```

- The signature of the function `QueryConnectionHandshakeProof` has changed, since the validation of self client and consensus state has been remove from the connection handshake: 

```diff
func (endpoint *Endpoint) QueryConnectionHandshakeProof() (
- clientState exported.ClientState, clientProof,
- consensusProof []byte, consensusHeight clienttypes.Height,
  connectionProof []byte, proofHeight clienttypes.Height,
)
```

- The functions [`GenerateClientStateProof` and `GenerateConsensusStateProof`](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/v8.0.0/testing/solomachine.go#L513-L547)
have been removed.

### API deprecation notice

- The testing package functions `Setup`, `SetupClients`, `SetupConnections`, `CreateConnections`, and `CreateChannels` of the `Coordinator` type have been deprecated and will be removed in v10. Please use the new functions `Setup`, `SetupClients`, `SetupConnections`, `CreateConnections`, `CreateChannels` of the `Path` type.

## Relayers

### Events

#### 02-client

- The [`header` attribute](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/v8.0.0/modules/core/02-client/keeper/events.go#L60) has been removed from the `update_client` event in [\#5110](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/5110).

#### 04-channel

- The constant [`AttributeVersion`](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/v8.0.0/modules/core/04-channel/types/events.go#L14) has been renamed to `AttributeKeyVersion`.
- The `packet_data` and the `packet_ack` attributes of the `send_packet`, `recv_packet` and `write_acknowledgement` events have been removed in [#6023](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/6023). The attributes `packet_data_hex` and `packet_ack_hex` should be used instead. The [constants `AttributeKeyData` and `AttributeKeyAck`](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/v8.0.0/modules/core/04-channel/types/events.go#L24-L27) have also been removed.

##### Channel upgrades
 
- The attributes `version`, `ordering` and `connection_hops` from the `channel_upgrade_init`, `channel_upgrade_try`, `channel_upgrade_ack`, `channel_upgrade_open`, `channel_upgrade_timeout` and `channel_upgrade_cancelled` events have been removed in [\#6063](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/6063).

## IBC Light Clients

### API removals

- The [`ExportMetadata` interface function](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/v8.0.0/modules/core/exported/client.go#L59) has been removed from the `ClientState` interface. Core IBC will export all key/value's within the 02-client store.  
- The [`ZeroCustomFields` interface function](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/v8.0.0/modules/core/exported/client.go#L64) has been removed from the `ClientState` interface.
- The following functions have also been removed from the `ClientState` interface: `Initialize`, `Status`, `GetLatestHeight`, `GetTimestampAtHeight`, `VerifyClientMessage`, `VerifyMembership`, `VerifyNonMembership`, `CheckForMisbehaviour`, `UpdateState`, `UpdateStateOnMisbehaviour`,  `CheckSubstituteAndUpdateState` and `VerifyUpgradeAndUpdateState`. ibc-go v9 decouples routing at the 02-client layer from the light clients' encoding structure (i.e. every light client implementation of the `ClientState` interface is not used anymore to route the requests to the right light client at the `02-client` layer, instead a *light client module* is registered for every light client type and 02-client routes the requests to the right light client module based on the client ID). Light client developers must implement the newly introduced `LightClientModule` interface and are encouraged to move the logic implemented in the functions of their light client's implementation of the `ClientState` interface to the equivalent function in the `LightClientModule` interface. The table below shows the equivalence between the `ClientState` interface functions that have been removed and the functions in the `LightClientModule` interface:

|`ClientState` interface|`LightClientModule` interface|
|-----------------------|-----------------------------|
|`Initialize`                   |`Initialize`                 |
|`Status`                       |`Status`                     |
|`GetLatestHeight`              |`LatestHeight`               |
|`GetTimestampAtHeight`         |`TimestampAtHeight`          |
|`VerifyClientMessage`          |`VerifyClientMessage`        |
|`VerifyMembership`             |`VerifyMembership`           |
|`VerifyNonMembership`          |`VerifyNonMembership`        |
|`CheckForMisbehaviour`         |`CheckForMisbehaviour`       |
|`UpdateState`                  |`UpdateState`                |
|`UpdateStateOnMisbehaviour`    |`UpdateStateOnMisbehaviour`  |
|`CheckSubstituteAndUpdateState`|`RecoverClient`              |
|`VerifyUpgradeAndUpdateState`  |`VerifyUpgradeAndUpdateState`|
|`ExportMetadata`               |                             |
|`ZeroCustomFields`             |                             |

Please check also the [Light client developer guide](../03-light-clients/01-developer-guide/01-overview.md) for more information. The light client module implementation for 07-tendermint may also be useful as reference.

### 06-solomachine

- The [`Initialize`](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/v8.0.0/modules/light-clients/06-solomachine/client_state.go#L85), [`Status`](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/v8.0.0/modules/light-clients/06-solomachine/client_state.go#L59), [`GetTimestampAtHeight`](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/v8.0.0/modules/light-clients/06-solomachine/client_state.go#L46) and [`UpdateStateOnMisbehaviour`](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/v8.0.0/modules/light-clients/06-solomachine/update.go#L105) functions in `ClientState` have been removed and all their logic has been moved to functions of the `LightClientModule`. The [`VerifyMembership`](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/v8.0.0/modules/light-clients/06-solomachine/client_state.go#L111) and [`VerifyNonMembership`](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/v8.0.0/modules/light-clients/06-solomachine/client_state.go#L168) functions have been made private.
- The [`Type` method](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/v8.0.0/modules/light-clients/06-solomachine/misbehaviour.go#L20) on `Misbehaviour` has been removed.

### 07-tendermint

- The [`IterateConsensusMetadata` function](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/v8.0.0/modules/light-clients/07-tendermint/store.go#L81) has been removed. The [`Initialize`](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/v8.0.0/modules/light-clients/07-tendermint/client_state.go#L192), [`Status`](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/v8.0.0/modules/light-clients/07-tendermint/client_state.go#L84), [`GetTimestampAtHeight`](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/v8.0.0/modules/light-clients/07-tendermint/client_state.go#L62), [`VerifyMembership`](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/v8.0.0/modules/light-clients/07-tendermint/client_state.go#L209), [`VerifyNonMembership`](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/v8.0.0/modules/light-clients/07-tendermint/client_state.go#L252) functions have been made private.

### 08-wasm

Refer to the [08-wasm migration documentation](../03-light-clients/04-wasm/09-migrations.md) for more information.

### 09-localhost

The 09-localhost light client has been made stateless and will no longer update the client on every block. The `ClientState` is constructed on demand when required. The `ClientState` itself is therefore no longer provable directly with `VerifyMembership` or `VerifyNonMembership`.

An [automatic migration handler](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/release/v9.0.x/modules/core/02-client/keeper/migrations.go#L49) is configured to prune all previously stored client state data on IBC module store migration from `ConsensusVersion` 6 to 7.
