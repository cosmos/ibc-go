# Migrating from v8 to v9

This guide provides instructions for migrating to a new version of ibc-go.

There are four sections based on the four potential user groups of this document:

- [Chains](#chains)
- [IBC Apps](#ibc-apps)
- [Relayers](#relayers)
- [IBC Light Clients](#ibc-light-clients)

**Note:** ibc-go supports golang semantic versioning and therefore all imports must be updated on major version releases.

## Chains

- No relevant changes were made in this release.

## IBC Apps

### API removals

The `exported.ChannelI` and `exported.CounterpartyChannelI` interfaces have been removed. Please use the concrete types.
The `exported.ConnectionI` and `exported.CounterpartyConnectionI` interfaces have been removed. Please use the concrete types.
The `exported.Proof` interface has been removed. Please use the `MerkleProof` concrete type.

The functions `GetState()`, `GetOrdering()`, `GetCounterparty()`, `GetConnectionHops()`, `GetVersion()` of the `Channel` type have been removed.
The functions `GetPortID()`, `GetChannelID()` of the `CounterpartyChannel` type have been removed.
The functions `GetClientID()`, `GetState()`, `GetCounterparty()`, `GetVersions()`, and `GetDelayPeriod` of the `Connection` type have been removed. 
The functions `GetClientID()`, `GetConnectionID()`, and `GetPrefix()` of the `CounterpartyConnection` type have been removed. 

The utility function `QueryLatestConsensusState` of `04-channel` CLI has been removed.

### API deprecation notice

The testing package functions `coordinator.Setup`, `coordinator.SetupClients`, `coordinator.SetupConnections`, `coordinator.CreateConnections`, and `coordinator.CreateChannels` have been deprecated and will be removed in v10.
Please use the new functions `path.Setup`, `path.SetupClients`, `path.SetupConnections`, `path.CreateConnections`, `path.CreateChannels`.

### IBC testing package

- The `mock.PV` type has been removed in favour of [`cmttypes.MockPV`](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/blob/v0.38.5/types/priv_validator.go#L50) ([#5709](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/5709)).
- Functions `ConstructUpdateTMClientHeader` and `ConstructUpdateTMClientHeaderWithTrustedHeight` of `TestChain` type have been replaced with `IBCClientHeader`. This function will construct a `07-tendermint` header to update the light client on the counterparty chain. The trusted height must be passed in as a non-zero height.
- `GetValsAtHeight` has been renamed to `GetTrustedValidators`
- `AssertEventsLegacy` function of `ibctesting` package (alias for `"github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/v9/testing"`)  has been removed and `AssertEvents` function should be used instead (ref: [#6070](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/6070)).

```diff
// testing/events.go
- func AssertEventsLegacy(
-   suite *testifysuite.Suite,
-   expected EventsMap,
-   actual []abci.Event,
- )

func AssertEvents(
  suite *testifysuite.Suite,
  expected []abci.Event,
  actual []abci.Event,
)
```

### IBC core

- `UnmarshalPacketData` now takes in the context, portID, and channelID. This allows the packet data to be unmarshaled based on the channel version.
- `Router` reference has been removed from IBC core keeper: [#6138](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/6138)

### ICS27 - Interchain Accounts

In [#5785](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/5785) the list of arguments of the `NewKeeper` constructor function of the host submodule was extended with an extra argument for the gRPC query router that the submodule uses when executing a [`MsgModuleQuerySafe`](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/eecfa5c09a4c38a5c9f2cc2a322d2286f45911da/proto/ibc/applications/interchain_accounts/host/v1/tx.proto#L41-L51) to perform queries that are module safe:

```diff
func NewKeeper(
  cdc codec.Codec, key storetypes.StoreKey, legacySubspace icatypes.ParamSubspace,
  ics4Wrapper porttypes.ICS4Wrapper, channelKeeper icatypes.ChannelKeeper,
  portKeeper icatypes.PortKeeper,	accountKeeper icatypes.AccountKeeper, 
  scopedKeeper exported.ScopedKeeper, msgRouter icatypes.MessageRouter,
+ queryRouter icatypes.QueryRouter, 
  authority string,
) Keeper
```

The legacy function `RegisterInterchainAccount` now takes an extra parameter to specify the ordering of new ICA channels:

```diff
func (k Keeper) RegisterInterchainAccount(
  ctx sdk.Context,
  connectionID, owner,
  version string,
+ ordering channeltypes.Order
) error {
```

## Relayers

- Renaming of event attribute keys in [#5603](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/5603).
- Removal of duplicate non-hexlified event attributes in [#6023](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/6023).

## IBC Light Clients

### API removals

The `ExportMetadata` interface function has been removed from the `ClientState` interface. Core IBC will export all key/value's within the 02-client store.  

The `ZeroCustomFields` interface function has been removed from the `ClientState` interface.

The following functions have also been removed from the `ClientState` interface: `Initialize`, `Status`, `GetLatestHeight`, `GetTimestampAtHeight`, `VerifyClientMessage`, `VerifyMembership`, `VerifyNonMembership`, `CheckForMisbehaviour`, `UpdateState`, `UpdateStateOnMisbehaviour`,  `CheckSubstituteAndUpdateState` and `VerifyUpgradeAndUpdateState`. ibc-go v9 decouples routing at the `02-client` layer from the light clients' encoding structure (i.e. every light client implementation of the `ClientState` interface is not used anymore to route the requests to the right light client at the `02-client` layer, instead a *light client module* is registered for every light client type and `02-client` routes the requests to the right light client module based on the client ID). Light client developers must implement the newly introduced `LightClientModule` interface and are encouraged to move the logic implemented in the functions of their light client's implementation of the `ClientState` interface to the equivalent function in the `LightClientModule` interface. The table below shows the equivalence between the `ClientState` interface functions that have been removed and the functions in the `LightClientModule` interface:

|`ClientState` interface|`LightClientModule` interface|
|-----------------------|-----------------------------|
|`Initialize`                   |`Initialize`                 |
|`Status`                       |`Status`                     |
|`GetLatestHeight`              |`LatestHeight`               |
|`GetTimestampAtHeight`         |`TimestampAtHeight`          |
|`VerifyClientMessage`          |`VerifyClientMessage`        |
|`VerifyMembership`             |`VerifyMembership`           |
|`VerifyNonMembership`          |`VerifyNonMembership`        |
|`CheckForMisbehaviour`         |`CheckForMisbehaviour`       |
|`UpdateState`                  |`UpdateState`                |
|`UpdateStateOnMisbehaviour`    |`UpdateStateOnMisbehaviour`  |
|`CheckSubstituteAndUpdateState`|`RecoverClient`              |
|`VerifyUpgradeAndUpdateState`  |`VerifyUpgradeAndUpdateState`|
|`ExportMetadata`               |                             |
|`ZeroCustomFields`             |                             |

Please check also the [Light client developer guide](../03-light-clients/01-developer-guide/01-overview.md) for more information. The light client module implementation for `07-tendermint` may also be useful as reference.

### 06-solomachine

The `Initialize`, `Status`, `GetTimestampAtHeight` and `UpdateStateOnMisbehaviour` functions in `ClientState` have been removed and all their logic has been moved to functions of the `LightClientModule`.

### 07-tendermint

The `IterateConsensusMetadata` function has been removed.

### 08-wasm

The `ExportMetadataMsg` struct has been removed and is no longer required for contracts to implement. Core IBC will handle exporting all key/value's written to the store by a light client contract.
The `ZeroCustomFields` interface function has been removed from the `ClientState` interface. Core IBC only used this function to set tendermint client states when scheduling an IBC software upgrade. The interface function has been replaced by a type assertion.
