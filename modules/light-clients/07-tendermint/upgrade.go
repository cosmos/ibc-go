// VerifyUpgradeAndUpdateState checks if the upgraded client has been committed by the current client
// It will zero out all client-specific fields and verify all data in client state that must
// be the same across all valid Tendermint clients for the new chain.
// Note, if there is a decrease in the UnbondingPeriod, then the TrustingPeriod, despite being a client-specific field
// is scaled down by the same ratio.
// VerifyUpgrade will return an error if:
// - the upgradedClient is not a Tendermint ClientState
// - the latest height of the client state does not have the same revision number or has a greater
// height than the committed client.
//   - the height of upgraded client is not greater than that of current client
//   - the latest height of the new client does not match or is greater than the height in committed client
//   - any Tendermint chain specified parameter in upgraded client such as ChainID, UnbondingPeriod,
//     and ProofSpecs do not match parameters set by committed client
