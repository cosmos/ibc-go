	// packetSenderAddress is determined by the underlying module, and may be empty if the sender is
	// unknown or undefined. The contract is expected to handle the callback within the user defined
	// gas limit, and handle any errors, or panics gracefully.

	// this context will not be persisted, and the error will be propagated to the underlying IBC
	// application, resulting in a packet send failure.

	// Implementations are provided with the packetSenderAddress and MAY choose to use this to perform
	// validation on the origin of a given packet. It is recommended to perform the same validation
	// on all source chain callbacks (SendPacket, AcknowledgementPacket, TimeoutPacket). This
	// defensively guards against exploits due to incorrectly wired SendPacket ordering in IBC stacks.
