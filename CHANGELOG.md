<!--
Guiding Principles:

Changelogs are for humans, not machines.
There should be an entry for every single version.
The same types of changes should be grouped.
Versions and sections should be linkable.
The latest version comes first.
The release date of each version is displayed.
Mention whether you follow Semantic Versioning.

Usage:

Change log entries are to be added to the Unreleased section under the
appropriate stanza (see below). Each entry should ideally include a tag and
the Github issue reference in the following format:

* (<tag>) \#<issue-number> message

The issue numbers will later be link-ified during the release process so you do
not have to worry about including a link manually, but you can if you wish.

Types of changes (Stanzas):

"Features" for new features.
"Improvements" for changes in existing functionality.
"Deprecated" for soon-to-be removed features.
"Bug Fixes" for any bug fixes.
"Client Breaking" for breaking CLI commands and REST routes used by end-users.
"API Breaking" for breaking exported APIs used by developers building on SDK.
"State Machine Breaking" for any changes that result in a different AppState given the same genesisState and txList.

* (transfer) [\#675](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/675) Transfer `NewKeeper` now takes in an ICS4Wrapper. The ICS4Wrapper may be the IBC Channel Keeper when ICS20 is not used in a middleware stack. The ICS4Wrapper is required for applications wishing to connect middleware to ICS20.
* (core) [\#650](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/650) Modify `OnChanOpenTry` IBC application module callback to return the negotiated app version. The version passed into the `MsgChanOpenTry` has been deprecated and will be ignored by core IBC.
* (core) [\#629](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/629) Removes the `GetProofSpecs` from the ClientState interface. This function was previously unused by core IBC.
* (transfer) [\#517](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/517) Separates the ICS 26 callback functions from `AppModule` into a new type `IBCModule` for ICS 20 transfer.

Allows for the mock module to be reused as a base application in middleware stacks.
* (channel) [\#882](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/882) The `WriteAcknowledgement` API now takes `exported.Acknowledgement` instead of a byte array
* (modules/core/ante) [\#950](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/950) Replaces the channel keeper with the IBC keeper in the IBC `AnteDecorator` in order to execute the entire message and be able to reject redundant messages that are in the same block as the non-redundant messages.

### State Machine Breaking

* (transfer) [\#818](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/818) Error acknowledgements returned from Transfer `OnRecvPacket` now include a deterministic ABCI code and error message.

### Improvements

* (client) [\#888](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/888) Add `GetTimestampAtHeight` to `ClientState`
* (interchain-accounts) [\#1037](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/1037) Add a function `InitModule` to the interchain accounts `AppModule`.

* (testing) [\#810](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/810) Additional testing function added to `Endpoint` type called `RecvPacketWithResult`. Performs the same functionality as the existing `RecvPacket` function but also returns the message result. `path.RelayPacket` no longer uses the provided acknowledgement argument and instead obtains the acknowledgement via MsgRecvPacket events.
* (connection) [\#721](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/721) Simplify connection handshake error messages when unpacking client state.
* (channel) [\#692](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/692) Minimize channel logging by only emitting the packet sequence, source port/channel, destination port/channel upon packet receives, acknowledgements and timeouts.
* [\#383](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/383) Adds helper functions for merging and splitting middleware versions from the underlying app version.
* (modules/core/05-port) [\#288](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/288) Making the 05-port keeper function IsBound public. The IsBound function checks if the provided portID is already binded to a module.
* (client) [\#724](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/724) `IsRevisionFormat` and `IsClientIDFormat` have been updated to disallow newlines before the dash used to separate the chainID and revision number, and the client type and client sequence.
* (channel) [\#644](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/644) Adds `GetChannelConnection` to the ChannelKeeper. This function returns the connectionID and connection state associated with a channel.
* (channel) [\647](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/647) Reorganizes channel handshake handling to set channel state after IBC application callbacks.
* (interchain-accounts) [\#1466](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/1466) Emit event when there is an acknowledgement during `OnRecvPacket`.

### Features

* [\#432](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/432) Introduce `MockIBCApp` struct to the mock module. Allows the mock module to be reused to perform custom logic on each IBC App interface function. This might be useful when testing out IBC applications written as middleware.
* [\#380](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/380) Adding the Interchain Accounts module v1
* [\#679](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/679) New CLI command `query ibc-transfer denom-hash <denom trace>` to get the denom hash for a denom trace; this might be useful for debug

* (modules/light-clients/07-tendermint) [\#141](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/141) Freeze the client if there's a conflicting header submitted for an existing consensus state.
* (modules/core/02-client) [\#8405](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/8405) Refactor IBC client update governance proposals to use a substitute client to update a frozen or expired client.
* (modules/core/02-client) [\#8673](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/8673) IBC upgrade logic moved to 02-client and an IBC UpgradeProposal is added.
* (modules/core/03-connection) [\#171](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/171) Introduces a new parameter `MaxExpectedTimePerBlock` to allow connections to calculate and enforce a block delay that is proportional to time delay set by connection.
* (core) [\#268](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/268) Perform a no-op on redundant relay messages. Previous behaviour returned an error. Now no state change will occur and no error will be returned.

### Improvements

* (04-channel) [\#220](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/220) Channel handshake events are now emitted with the channel keeper.
* (core/02-client) [\#205](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/205) Add in-place and genesis migrations from SDK v0.42.0 to ibc-go v1.0.0. Solo machine protobuf definitions are migrated from v1 to v2. All solo machine consensus states are pruned. All expired tendermint consensus states are pruned.
* (modules/core) [\#184](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/184) Improve error messages. Uses unique error codes to indicate already relayed packets.
* (07-tendermint) [\#182](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/182) Remove duplicate checks in upgrade logic.
* (modules/core/04-channel) [\#7949](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/7949) Standardized channel `Acknowledgement` moved to its own file. Codec registration redundancy removed.
* (modules/core/04-channel) [\#144](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/144) Introduced a `packet_data_hex` attribute to emit the hex-encoded packet data in events. This allows for raw binary (proto-encoded message) to be sent over events and decoded correctly on relayer. Original `packet_data` is DEPRECATED. All relayers and IBC event consumers are encouraged to switch to `packet_data_hex` as soon as possible.
* (core/04-channel) [\#197](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/197) Introduced a `packet_ack_hex` attribute to emit the hex-encoded acknowledgement in events. This allows for raw binary (proto-encoded message) to be sent over events and decoded correctly on relayer. Original `packet_ack` is DEPRECATED. All relayers and IBC event consumers are encouraged to switch to `packet_ack_hex` as soon as possible.
* (modules/light-clients/07-tendermint) [\#125](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/125) Implement efficient iteration of consensus states and pruning of earliest expired consensus state on UpdateClient.
* (modules/light-clients/07-tendermint) [\#141](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/141) Return early in case there's a duplicate update call to save Gas.
* (modules/core/ante) [\#235](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/235) Introduces a new IBC Antedecorator that will reject transactions that only contain redundant packet messages (and accompany UpdateClient msgs). This will prevent relayers from wasting fees by submitting messages for packets that have already been processed by previous relayer(s). The Antedecorator is only applied on CheckTx and RecheckTx and is therefore optional for each node.

### Features

* [\#198](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/198) New CLI command `query ibc-transfer escrow-address <port> <channel id>` to get the escrow address for a channel; can be used to then query balance of escrowed tokens

### Client Breaking Changes

* (02-client/cli) [\#196](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/196) Rename `node-state` cli command to `self-consensus-state`.

## IBC in the Cosmos SDK Repository

The IBC module was originally released in [v0.40.0](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.40.0) of the SDK.
Please see the [Release Notes](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.40.0/RELEASE_NOTES.md).

The IBC module is also contained in the releases for [v0.41.x](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.41.0) and [v0.42.x](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.42.0).
Please see the Release Notes for [v0.41.x](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.41.0/RELEASE_NOTES.md) and [v0.42.x](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.42.0/RELEASE_NOTES.md).

The IBC module was removed in the commit hash [da064e13d56add466548135739c5860a9f7ed842](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/commit/da064e13d56add466548135739c5860a9f7ed842) on the SDK. The release for SDK v0.43.0 will be the first release without the IBC module.

Backports should be made to the [release/v0.42.x](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/release/v0.42.x) branch on the SDK.
