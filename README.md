The [Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol (IBC)](https://ibcprotocol.dev/) allows blockchains to talk to each other. This end-to-end, connection-oriented, stateful protocol provides reliable, ordered, and authenticated communication between heterogeneous blockchains. For a high-level explanation of what IBC is and how it works, please read [this blog post](https://medium.com/the-interchain-foundation/eli5-what-is-ibc-def44d7b5b4c).

This IBC implementation in Golang is built as a Cosmos SDK module. To understand more about how to use the `ibc-go` module as well as about the IBC protocol, please check out the Interchain Developer Academy [section on IBC](https://tutorials.cosmos.network/academy/3-ibc/), or [our docs](https://ibc.cosmos.network/main/ibc/overview.html).

## Roadmap

For an overview of upcoming changes to ibc-go take a look at the [roadmap](./docs/docs/01-ibc/09-roadmap.md).

This roadmap is also available as a [project board](https://github.com/orgs/cosmos/projects/7/views/25).

For the latest expected release timelines, please check [here](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/wiki/Release-timeline).

## Releases

We run biweekly community calls to update the community with our current direction and gather feedback on what to work on next. The community calls are also a platform for you to update everyone else with what you're working on, ask questions and find opportunities to collaborate. Please join [this Google group](https://groups.google.com/g/ibc-community) to receive a calendar invitation for the meeting.

## Contributing

If you're interested in contributing to ibc-go, please take a look at the [contributing guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md). We welcome and appreciate community contributions!

This project adheres to ibc-go's [code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

To help contributors understand which issues are good to pick up, we have the following two categories:

- Issues with the label [`good first issue`](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) should be pretty well defined and are best suited for developers new to ibc-go.
- Issues with the label [`help wanted`](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) are a bit more involved and they usually require some familiarity already with the codebase.

If you are interested in working on an issue, please comment on it; then we will be able to assign it to you. We will be happy to answer any questions you may have and help you out while you work on the issue.

If you have any general questions or feedback, please reach out to us in the [IBC Gang Discord server](https://discord.com/channels/955868717269516318/955883113484013578).
