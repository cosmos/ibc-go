# golangci-feature runs on pull requests from branches that do not target main.
#
# Working on feature branches (PRs where the PR base-ref != main) is a common
# workflow used, in order to make the merging of PRs easier certain lints are excluded
# when it makes sense. Currently, unused lints are excluded since many PRs will add
# unused code that will be used in a later PR.
